## Description
A simple TODO list. This was the first full stack application I built at Prime Academy.
A user can enter and item Todo, mark it as compelete, or delete it.

## I Learned
The best/hardest part was connecting the front end to a server and storing/retrieving data from the database.
Understanding AJAX was the first time I tripped at Prime. Now I feel this app is a little rudimentary. :)
